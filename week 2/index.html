            <h2 style="color:rgb(26, 214, 41); font-family: Courier;">Why is the internet so great, you may ask?</h2>

                <strong><u>I like to think that I was born in the right generation.</u><br><br></strong>

                The internet has made it easier for everyone to connect to each other, wherever<br>
                they are on the planet. Before, we had to send letters to each other, or go through<br>
                large encyclopedias just to get accurate information. Even then, encyclopedias were not<br>
                always up to date. But now, most things are as easy as 1-2-3. We have our smartphones,<br>
                small compact devices that can scour the internet for information, play our music,<br>
                send our messages, and more. It's still crazy to think that these small devices serve <br>
                the purpose of multiple devices back in the 1990s. Such is technology. Always advancing.</p>

            Look at this kid. It took me, at max, 4 seconds, to find a picture related to the internet.</h2>
